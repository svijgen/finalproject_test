		<h2>Education</h2>
			<h3>Educating Children Facing Trauma and Homelessness</h3>
				<p>We specialize in educating children experiencing trauma and supporting families in achieving long-term stability.</p>
				<p>The number one issue faced by our students is overcoming trauma. Trauma happens through an experience that is emotional painful, distressful, or shocking, which often results in lasting mental and phsyical effects.</p>
				<p>CHildren experience trauma due to homelessness, poverty, abuse, witnessing abuse, separation from a parent, and crises within the family. Due to trauma and additional obstacbles, many children come to First Place up to three grade leverls behind their peers.</p>
				<p>Our staff is highly trained in recognizing the individual needs of children experiencing trauma and providing the support they need to continue learning and growing.</p>
			<h3>First Place has two main Education Programs:</h3>
				<ul class="education_list">
					<li>1. Elementary Education, Kindergarten through 6th grade</li>
					<li>2. Classroom Without Walls dropout prevention curriculum and consulting</li>
				</ul>
			<h5>Elementary Education</h5>
				<p>Our goal in working with families is long-term stability. We know it takes more than an education and a place to live to make this a reality.</p>
				<p>Our focus is on working with each individual child and family unit in their personal journey. Each part of our education program is designed to help students successfully transition into their next school and have the skills they need to graduate junior high, then high school, then college and become successful, productive adults.</p>
